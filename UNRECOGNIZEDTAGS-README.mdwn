# Overview

This plugin is useful to system administrators who need to quickly scan
an installation for any and all template tags that are unrecognized by
the system. Unrecognized tags can result from the following:

* core template tags being removed after first being deprecated
* disabling a plugin that provides template tags that templates depend
  upon
* deleting a plugin that provides template tags
* a plugin that is broken for some reason

This plugin helps save you time because Movable Type will throw an error 
message when it encounters an unrecognized tag in the course of 
rebuilding, or when you edit a template containing one, but this 
means that in order to identify all such tags you must either open 
every template or repeatedly rebuild, resolve or <mt:Ignore> the 
first tag encountered (which will stop the rebuild), and then try 
rebuilding again.

UnrecognizedTags is intended to simplify this process. It can be 
especially useful when upgrading, or preparing to use or discontinue 
use of a particular plugin, or for large or legacy installations all 
of whose blogs and templates aren't fully understood by the people 
currently dealing with the system.

# Usage

The plugin adds an "Unrecognized Tags" menu item to the Tools menu at 
the System Overview level. When you select this item, UnrecognizedTags 
will generate and display a listing of all usages of unrecognized tags, 
grouped by tag, and listing the blog and template (with a link to edit 
the template) in which each usage occurs.

# Support

"UnrecognizedTags" is not an official Six Apart release, and as such 
support from Six Apart for this plugin is not available.
